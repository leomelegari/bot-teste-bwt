# ü§ñ BWT Tracking Bot

This project is a personal bot built in **TypeScript** to meet a very specific need: continuously tracking my shipments with the logistics company **Brasil Web Transporte (BWT)**.  

The bot sends a request to the BWT endpoint every 60 seconds, checking for any updates in the tracking information. If any movement is detected, it sends a message directly to my private bot on Telegram.

---

## üì¶ Why I Built This

I created this bot because I needed a reliable way to monitor my packages with **Brasil Web Transporte**. Instead of manually checking the tracking page, I wanted real-time notifications whenever there was a change in status ‚Äî such as departure, arrival, or delivery.

This bot automates that process by polling the tracking endpoint every minute and notifying me immediately through Telegram when updates occur.
